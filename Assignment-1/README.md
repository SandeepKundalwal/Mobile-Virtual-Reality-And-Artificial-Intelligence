<h3>Q1: ApplyingPhysicsToCube</h3>
<ul>Take a cube and a plane and put the cube on the plane.</ul>
<ul>Please give an appropriate color to the cube (yellow) and the plane (green).</ul>
<ul>Now, please convert the cube into 5 cubes on the plane, where each cube is placed at a random location in the plane.</ul>
<ul>Now, raise these cubes to a height above the plane and apply physics such that all 5 cubes fall on the plane upon running the game.
</ul>

<h3>Q2: MoveCube</h3>
<ul>Take a cube and a plane and put the cube on the plane. Please give an appropriate color to the cube (yellow) and the plane (green).</ul>
<ul>Now, make the cube move on the plane such that by pressing the left or right key, the cube rotates anti-clockwise or clockwise respectively. Furthermore, upon clicking the forward key the cube moves forward in the facing direction.</ul>
<ul>Now, enable the cube to jump once upon space bar press so that the user can also make
it jump by pressing the space bar</ul>
